ZL Simulation has recently released a freeware Cessna 152 for X-Plane 11 and 12, featuring a realistic flight model and physics, PBR textures, a 3D cockpit, and much more. 

The Cessna 152 is one of the most popular trainer aircraft in the world, with over 7,500 built during its eight years of production (1977-1985). It was a modernization of the Cessna 150 design with an improved engine, greater useful load, noise level reduction, and better compatibility with 100LL fuel. They were powered by a Lycoming O-235-L2C engine producing 110 horsepower at 2,550 RPM, with a range of 416 nautical miles, a 14,700ft service ceiling, and 123 miles per hour of cruise speed.

Production ended when Cessna decided to end production of all of their light aircraft, with a successor being developed in the form of the unsuccessful 162 Skycatcher (2007-2013).

According to the developer, the project has been worked on for over three years, featuring a realistic flight model, PBR texturing, a 3D cockpit, custom FMOD sounds, ten liveries, a paintkit, performance-friendly optimization, windshield rain effects on X-Plane 12, a built-in Garmin GNS 430 GPS, and custom coded systems using XTLua.
